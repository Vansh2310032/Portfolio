            <h2>FIGMA</h2>
            <p>Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that’s taken the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch or Adobe Illustrator, which are standalone applications, Figma can be run entirely from a web browser and, therefore, works not only on Macs but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. It's also free to use!<br><br>

                Another big advantage of Figma is that it allows real-time collaboration on the same file. When using conventional “offline” apps like Sketch and Illustrator, if designers want to share their work, they typically have to export it to an image file and then send it via email or instant message.<br><br>
                
                In Figma, instead of exporting static images, we can simply share a link to the Figma file for clients and colleagues to open in their browsers. This in itself saves significant time and can streamline a designer’s workflow. But more importantly, it means that clients and colleagues can interact more richly with the work and review the latest version of the file.</p>

            <h2>WEB DEV</h2>
            <p>This is one of the fundamental building blocks of the web. HTML, or “HyperText Markup Language,” has been around in some form since roughly 1993, when it was created by physicist Tim Berners-Lee. It’s now in its fifth generation, HTML5.
                <br>CSS or “Cascading Style Sheets” works with HTML to create the format for web pages. It works on top of the foundation of a page that was created with HTML. It also helps adapt pages to different formats optimized for desktops or mobile devices. The latest standard is CSS3, meaning they are in their third generation.
                <br>JavaScript, which is often abbreviated to JS, is another front-end programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries like JQuery. Whereas HTML & CSS are used to control presentation, formatting, and layout, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different web elements.

            <h2>UNREAL ENGINE</h2>
            <p>Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) is a cutting-edge real-time 3D creation tool developed by Epic Games, designed to empower developers and artists in various industries, including gaming, film, architecture, and virtual reality. With its advanced capabilities, UE5 enables the creation of stunning, high-fidelity interactive experiences that push the boundaries of what’s possible in digital content. The engine combines powerful tools with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to both seasoned professionals and newcomers.<br>

                One of the standout features of UE5 is Nanite, a virtualized geometry system that allows artists to use film-quality assets in real-time without compromising performance. This technology enables the rendering of incredibly detailed environments, accommodating complex scenes with millions of polygons. Coupled with Lumen, a fully dynamic global illumination solution, UE5 provides realistic lighting and reflections that react in real-time to changes in the scene, enhancing the overall immersion of the experience.<br>
